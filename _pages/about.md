Hi, my name is Kaiyi Huang. I am a graduate student from Department of Mathematics in UW-Madison.

My research interest lies in harmonic analysis and its applications in PDEs, number theory, combinatorics, geometric measure theory and machine learning.

I obtained BSc in Mathematics from CUHK in 2019.
